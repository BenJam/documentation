### Google
_is hungry for your linked datas so she can serve you up search traffic_

You know Google,right? That little business based in Mountain View. The one that serves hand-crafted, small-batch, globally-sourced datas in return for your eyeballs? That Google.

### Searcher (Ada)
_A developer with a problem, she is looking for something to help solve it._ 

- Age: 25
- Education: BSc Computer Science
- Lives: London.
- Works: Marketing agency.
- Role: Developer/Engineer.
- Frequent tasks: Estimating projects, developing new web sites.
- Pain points: Frequently switching project, new requirements, high workload, long hours.

Ada is a senior software developer, four years out of her computer science degree. She cycles from home into the office in Soho, London where she works at small but ambitious marketing agency who specialise in 'micro-sites'. She works alongside four other developers and two front-end designers. The team has two account managers who support them, and two directors who do the 'creative' work. The agency is run on a tight budget and works in a competitive market, bidding for projects against other small agencies. Like a lot of young agencies they rely on open source software to lower their production costs. 

### Consumer (Bee)
_has a product or products that incorporates some FOSS dependencies. She needs to ensure the product(s) are well maintained, free of vulnerabilities and license compatible._

- Age: 32
- Education: A-level
- Lives: Staffordshire
- Works: Web Agency
- Role: CTO 
- Frequent tasks: Managing product releases, troubleshooting and supporting developers.
- Pain points: Automatic deployment, streamlining large codebase, supporting deprecated dependencies.

Bee is CTO at a web agency based in Staffordshire. She works from home four days a week, traveling to the office on a Tuesday. She leads a team of ten developers with support from designers, user experience consultants, content editors and account managers. In 2014 the agency decided to specialise in software for museums and galleries. They built a product based on Node.js. Over the years the product added new features for larger customers, with it increased the size of the codebase and its dependencies. A large museum in New York would like to use it on-premises but to do so the product has to meet their strict compliance criteria.

### Producer (Charlie)
_is a developer with a successful FOSS project. She's looking to understand more about those who use her project, attract more contributors and manage their contributions well._

- Age: 28
- Education: MSc 
- Lives: Berkley 
- Works: Large Technology Company
- Role: Developer
- Frequent tasks: Ticket prioritisation, bug fixing, updating dependencies.
- Pain points: Supporting legacy features, understanding users, growing community.

Charlie works at a large technology company, she chose this company because the company allows her to work one daya week on open source projects. For three years Charlie has been a contributor to Pipe, an ORM library. Pipe has a *very* active community of users posting questions, ticketing bugs and feature requests and — whenever a release is shipped — complaints. Charlie suspects Pipe is used by several thousand developers but there are only five other people contributing to the project actively. Between them they struggle between work and family to maintain the project. 

### Extender (Danni)
_has her own ideas. She wants access to the raw data so that she can mash up her own service and offer it to the world._

- Age: 42
- Education: PhD 
- Lives: New York
- Works: Charitable Foundation
- Role: Lead Developer
- Frequent tasks: scraping websites, parsing package manifests, wrangling databases 
- Pain points: data gathering

Danni has been studying software ecosystems for six months as part of a grant-funded piece of work from a charitable foundation. She is contracted for the next year to produce a website highlighting tools that support end-user privacy. She would like to train an algorithm using libraries.io data to identify patterns and highlight other software to investigate.
